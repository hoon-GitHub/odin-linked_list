Project assignment page: [Project: Linked List](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists)\
Project started on: **5/22/2024**\
Project finished on: **TBD**

### Thoughts
- Learned about data structures, efficiency (time/space complexity, in the big O notation)
- Learned how to implement a linked list in JS (remembered doing this in C and Java, back in collage)
